              <h3>The Origins of Wikipedia</h3>
            </div>

            <p>
              Wikipedia was founded in 2001 and rests on the principle of the democratization of knowledge. The earliest realistic proposal for an online enyclopedia was made by Rick Gates in 1993. His site crashed and burned before publishing anything.
              Later, in 2000, Richard Stallman championed the idea that there should be no central authority editing the entries of an online enyclopedia.
              This stood in stark contrast to the digital enyclopedias of the time such as Microsoft Encarta and the Enyclopedia Britannica.
              The open-source movement contributed greatly toward the motivation to develop a free open encylopedia. 
              However, when started by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, Wikipedia was intended to just aid Nupedia, a site that published peer-review papers.
              Nupedia was publishing content very slowly and Sanger thought a wiki could help boost the rate of content production.
              Wikipedia was officially launched with its own domain wikipedia.com on 15 January 2001. Wikipedia surpassed Nupedia, quickly becoming a global project.
              Nupedia writers were encouraged to write the first articles and appeals to volunteers began two days later.
              Over the course of the year word got around about Wikipedia and new articles began to be published at a rapid rate.
              By September the site was covered in The New York Times by which point it had more than 10,000 articles. It would see that number reach more than 40,000 the following autumn.

              <h4>Funding</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              In its early days the server space needed to handle traffic was donated by Bomis - an early internet company.
              Wikipedia in funded today by donations which are made to the Wikimedia Foundation. 
              The site is entirely free to all. 
              In the 2018/2019 financial year Wikimedia received 120 million dollars in donations.
              The foundations assests were estimated to be worth 165 million dollars that year.

              <h4>Breadth of Wikipedia</h4>
            </div>

            <p>
              From 2001 Wikipedia grew at an astonishing rate. By 2003 there were 100,000 English articles and German Wikipedia, the next largest, had more than 10,000.
              By the end of 2004 the site had 1 million articles in 100 languages - with half of these in English.
              Wikipedia had grown so popular that it was even banned for two weeks by the Chinese Communist Party in the summer of 2004.
              In 2006 Wales introduced a new feature to manage the quality of the overwhelming volume of articles. He asked the community to focus on upgrading the quality of just 100,000 articles - claiming he would prefer that to 1,000,000 new ones.
              By 2007, Wikipedia had 5 million editors working on 7.5 million articles.
              By 2016, Japanese Wikipedia joined twelve other languages boasting more than one million articles.
              By 2019, Wikipedia, according to Alexa.com, was the seventh most visited website in the world. It was also in 2019 that China expanded its existing block on Wikipedia to all of its languages.
              In 2020 English Wikipedia has reached six million articles. Historians have claimed that the evolution of the article on the COVID-19 pandemic will offer useful information to future historians.

              <h4>Fake News</h4>
            </div>

            <p>
              In 2017-18 under pressure to address concerns over fake news, 
              YouTube and Facebook declared they would rely on Wikipedia to help users avoid misinformation.
              This has become especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the site's readership spike.

              In addition to its breadth of content, Wikipedia's linking feature offers users quick ways to explore information.
              This linking can allow a user to spend hours reading deeper into an article's content. The links have also spawned a new online game called the Wiki Game.
              The Wiki Game is played between two players who must start on a randomly 
              selected site (accessed using Wikipedia's "Random Article" feature) 
              and using hyperlinks alone reach an unrelated, agreed upon site. The game gives one a sense of the enormity of Wikipedia.
