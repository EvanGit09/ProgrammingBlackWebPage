                  <h3>The Rise of Digital News</h3>
                    <p>
                      
Tech has changed the way society consumes information - but this is not necessarily a bad thing.
As the CEO of one of largest technology companies in the world puts it:

 “Paper is no longer a big part of my day. I get 90% of my news online, and when I go to a meeting and want to jot things down, I bring my Tablet PC. It's fully synchronized with my office machine so I have all the files I need. 
Bill Gates, Microsoft CEO” And Bill Gates isn’t alone. The past twenty-five years have shown a dramatic shift in the means by which people obtain information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Throughout the 20th century, the desire for newspapers gradually evolved into radio which then developed into television.
But with each shift, the previous outlet was rendered more and more obselete and identified a universal theme: that people will always want to obtain news as quickly as possible and will embrace any new technology that permits them to do so. 

It’s hard to say if the rapid flow of information has caused people to be more connected to their computer and smartphones or whether the fact that people are so connected puts more pressure on information providers to deliver news more rapidly. 
Regardless of the motivation, it’s clear that the Internet has changed our daily life, and will continue to until we reach the talked about point of singularity. 
We can now access information seven days a week, all day, every day from the comfort of our own homes. 
A simple Google search provides hundreds of sources that appear instantly and can provide a wealth of information at our fingertips.
And, although arguably the internet has done harm to the traditional media outlets, many have adopted online forums from websites, to Twitter and Facebook and have found extra revenue from 
online subscribers. Plus, 'no longer are news editors or governments the gatekeepers of information because the costs of distribution have almost completely dissapeared.2' News and what 
is considered newsworthy is in the hands of the people in a way that it never was before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The process before a story is published has also changed. The web is the go to point for multiple perspectives and a catalouge of extensive knowledge and reasearch - if you are willing to look.
Furthermore, all though social media has made a dent in traditional media outlets it isn't all bad. We’re now bombarded with live streaming, requests for user generated content, and ‘fake news’. 
The pace at which news is delivered and digested has hit warp speed – and unfortunatly 
with haste often comes inaccuracy, and in the rush to be the first to publish a story, sometimes we are not presented with the full picture. The rise of ‘fake news’ and the public’s growing awareness of this has also meant people are less naïve to things they read online, and will question: ‘Is this true?’

So, although social media is often the fastest way to obtain information, it can be fragmented. Because of this, traditional journalism still has its place, and many look to trusted sources for the facts. Often a story will ‘break’ on social media, but until it is verified by a newspaper, readers may not 100% trust its legitimacy.
Some think that traditional news media channels will die out in the next decade or so, however the best approach is for the two to work side-by-side and complement each other, to not only survive, but thrive.

                    <p>
                      A story, that will make you see the power of digital media - working with the traditional form of investigation, is the Panama Papers:
The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that detail financial and attorney–client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. The documents, some dating back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in April 2016.

The documents contain personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had previously been kept private.While offshore business entities are legal (see Offshore Magic Circle), reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions. 
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) is an independent, Washington, D.C.-based international network of more than 200 investigative journalists and 100 media organizations in over 70 countries.Launched in 1997 by the Center for Public Integrity, ICIJ was spun off in February 2017 into a fully independent organization working on "issues such as "cross-border crime, corruption, and the accountability of power."
The ICIJ has exposed smuggling and tax evasion by multinational tobacco companies (2000), "by organized crime syndicates; investigated private military cartels, asbestos companies,and climate change lobbyists; and broke new ground by publicizing details of Iraq and Afghanistan war contracts."(Source: wikepedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers)
This group of journalists shifted through terabytes of data, more data than leaks from WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden combined. Would, all of the journalists working on the data have been able to communicate without the internet, and would the
magnitude of what they had found be as impactful if not told through hundreds of online papers at the same time with graphics - probably not.
