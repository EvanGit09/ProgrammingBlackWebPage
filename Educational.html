              <h3>How The Internet Changed Ecucation Forever</h3>
            </div>

            <p>

Throughout time, the educational system has remained scarely similar. 
Whilst the standard of education has risen, the bar the students are expected to achieve has sky rocketed to beyond anything that is even theasable.

Before the internet was created the main source of information was from books and newspapers and so everyone heavily relied on the information that they had read before. 
This was very limiting because it is just not possible to gather all the information that todays students need in books, 
students of today need a lot more assistance because they have a lot more to take in. It almost isn't fair. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the heads' union ASCL, recently stated: 
"While the increased rigour may have been in the interest of the more able students, it had come at the expense of the more vulnerable ones."
He then called for the exams to be tweaked to make them "less of an ordeal" and said a more "humane way" to assess the abilities of young people was required."

              <h4>Research Is Conducted Mostly Online</h4>
            </div>
            <p>

              When preparing for a research paper or homework assignment, a whopping 93% of students of students turn to Google for the answer. Although librarians and educators have discouraged the use of Wikipedia, students consistently favor the site for quick and (mostly) reliable information. The availability of current, accurate information 24/7 saves students time and energy that used to be spent searching for the right library book.

              <h4>Many Teachers Use Online Learning Elements in the Classroom</h4>
            </div>

            <p>
              Students aren’t the only ones browsing the web. Around 90% of educators use some form of social media in the classes they teach. Many more use online videos and other applicable media elements to supplement class material. This blend of in-person lectures with targeted online content offers the best of both worlds.

              <h4>Communication Is Vastly Improved</h4>
            </div>

            <p>
              Communication used to be limited to class time and planned study groups. Now, contacting your teacher with a question, connecting with classmates for a group discussion, and keeping up to date on classwork after an absence is a mere click away. Students can effortlessly communicate with their teachers and peers from anywhere, and vice versa!

              <h4>More Students Are Opting for Online Classes</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              Over one third of students are taking at least some of their classes online, with a total of 6.3 million students in the US taking at least one online class in 2016. The shift to online courses is continuing to grow and is expected to continue flourishing alongside advances in online learning.

            <div class="headings1">
              <h4>Acceptance of Online Learning Has Grown</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              For many years, online learning programs were looked down by educators and employers. The worries were not unfounded, but mainly stemmed from online programs lacking accreditation or association with a trusted university. Now, many esteemed colleges also offer distance learning programs and blended classes. Two thirds of educators now believe online courses can be equally valuable as those conducted in a traditional classroom setting.
            </p>

            <div class="headings1">
              <h4>More Flexible Learning Options</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              Arguably the most popular change provided by online learning is flexibility. The rigid schedule of a traditional education used to limit who was able to complete a degree. Those who worked full-time or were raising a family alongside pursuing higher learning were hard-pressed to make it happen. Because of the Internet, students aren’t limited by tight schedules. Online learning offers a customizable experience that can’t be beat.

            <div class="headings1">
              <h4>Interactive Learning Improves Engagement</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
              In previous decades, self-assessment was limited to homemade flashcards and study guides. Online learning platforms integrate valuable information with built-in assessments and interactive activities that help both students and teachers track progress.
